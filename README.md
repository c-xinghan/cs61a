# Why choose CS61A over other courses (e.g. Harvard's CS50)?

Because 61A prioritises teaching CS ***concepts*** over languages, it dives deeper into these concepts than any language-focused CS course. This course's philosophy is summarised in the [course text](https://www.composingprograms.com/)'s description:

> In the tradition of SICP, this text focuses on methods for abstraction, programming paradigms, and techniques for managing the complexity of large programs. These concepts are illustrated primarily using the Python 3 programming language.

The examples and exercises within offered perspectives [never](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61a/sp20/hw/hw04/#mobiles) [seen](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61a/sp20/hw/hw03/#q6) [before](https://www.composingprograms.com/pages/27-object-abstraction.html#generic-functions) in other courses that I have completed; this was a course that made a Diploma in Information Technology holder struggle and realise how little they truly understand.

No other "intro to CS" programme has ever been this challenging, yet so intriguing and rewarding to tackle. Going through a course like this is a great way to build a strong CS foundation, and this foundation will go a long way in making new languages and frameworks much easier to learn in the future.

# How do I take this course?
[This](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61a/sp20/) is the webpage for the course's Spring 2020 run. I watch the recorded lectures and attempt the assignments in order. Detailed instructions for setting up and using course-related tools can be found in the [first lab activity](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61a/sp20/lab/lab00/).

The autograder tool works for **ALL** assignments and does **NOT** require a UC Berkeley email account to run, as long as the `--local` parameter is passed in after the `ok` command.
